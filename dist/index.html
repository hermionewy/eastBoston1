						Amazonions in Eastie

						Most notably, more than half of Eastie’s population is Latino while only 13% of Amazon’s employees are.
						Despite this large difference in diversity, any Amazonions moving to Eastie would represent only a small shift in the diversity of the neighborhood as a whole.</p>
					<p class="eb-content">Here is what it would look like if these two groups came together. There are roughly 40,000 living in East Boston right now and Amazon is likely to bring around 50,000 employees.</p>

					East Boston has 40,000 residents, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://statisticalatlas.com/neighborhood/Massachusetts/Boston/East-Boston/Race-and-Ethnicity">Statistical Atlas</a>.<br/>
					Amazon is expected to invest over $5 billion in construction and grow this second headquarters to include as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs.<br/><br/>
					If each circle represents 100 people, this is what East Boston and Amazon headquatersII looks like.<br/><br/>

					Here is a closer look at the population by race of each group. <br/><br/>
					More than half of East Boston residents are Hispanic and only 34 percent are White.<br/><br/>
					While 48 percent of Amazon's employees are White and only 15 percent are Hispanic.
				</p>
				<p class="trigger" id="trigger-2">
					If Amazon came to East Boston, it would dramatically change the diversity of the neighborhood. East Boston will become a white-dominated neighborhood. At least in the daytime.
				</p>
				<p class="trigger" id="trigger-3">
					Of course, not all Amazon employees are living in East Boston. <br/><br/>
					This is what it may look like if three percent Amazon employees reside in East Boston, as they did in Seattle.<br/><br/>
					Try other percentage to see the difference.<br/><br/>

					<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-dark" id="btn4">20%</button>
					<br/><br/>
					Even if 10 percent of Amazon employees decided to live in East Boston, they couldn’t erase the neighborhood’s diversity. <br/><br/>

						But not all of Amazon’s new employees would be external hires,
						some jobs could be filled by current Eastie residents.
						Because the largest population in Eastie is Latino,
						one of the most pressing questions to follow is what jobs are Latinos most likely to fill at Amazon based on the employees they have now?
						Take a look at the chart below to find the answer.

						Yes. The answer is predominantly laborers and service workers.
